# Easy-encryption
Diferent ways to encrypt your information(string, text or files) without dealing modules like cryptography,crypto.cipher etc..and 
avoid them writing 7 or more lines of codes to get the job done encrypting. Don't get me wrong, those modules that i mentioned are 
useful and add more security to your data but in order to reach that goal you have to types several lines. My codes are easy to 
understand and get the job done quickly. 

1*Encrypt_file.py --> encrypt any files using XOR or +/- operator with a password.

2*Encrypt_msg.py --> encrypt any msgs, words, texts using XOR or +/- with a password 

3*Encryp_substi.py -->encrypt a msg by substitution of letters,numbers,symbol(characters)....


A Complex password will do a big diference to protect your data against hackers. otherwise just enable hashlib tosecure more your
data. 

From this codes gave me an idea to create a program called "FiXOR", encrypt files but with a high security + hashing password 
throught Key derivation functions. [FiX0R](https://github.com/icodexys/FiXOR-project)
