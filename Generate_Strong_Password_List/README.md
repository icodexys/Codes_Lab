# Password Generator

Generate random passwords. I wrote 2 ways but similar of both:

Genpass.py ---> by using different modules, methods will generate a random password and you can choose the amount of length and how many passwords will be generated.


PassGen-Customized.py ---> Here you can choose the amount of lenghts of letters, numbers and special character also how many passwords will be generated(same as above)
