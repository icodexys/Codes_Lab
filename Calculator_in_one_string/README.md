# Calculator in one string
Calculate everything what is in the string, of course must have only 
numbers and supported operators .

ex.: "34+7*3-44/2*2.5"
 
Is a function that will perform same task as eval() does but limited, 
the function is wrote in scientific mode which it follows the arithmetic rules. 

Despite the existence of the eval() method in python, i wrote this generic to exercise my logic and understand 
how eval() is wrote like.

It will perfom a huge operation using - + * / and ^(Exponential notation) in one string.

operators supported:
- --Addition
- --Multiplacation
- --subtraction
- --Division
- --Exponential notation(Still in Development)
